# FreeCDN

## Proposal 
I wish there would be a frontend host service for free, 
and it would like to be a service like bower. User can 
submit their code and provide CDN service for free. Well,
it would be static hosting, so it won't harm to the 
server.

## Design
1. It would be able to register the package, similar to 
`bower register`
2. It would be able to host sub domain package, similar 
to Meteor
3. It should be able to be accessed anywhere including 
China.

## Open Source Project
1. It is a open source project, so all companies, 
university could join and host the mirror site.
2. It is well organized and functional, and should 
be able to generate the funding by itself, similar to 
Lavarel project.
