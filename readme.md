# FreeCDN

## Proposal 
I wish there would be a frontend host service for free, 
and it would like to be a service like bower. User can 
submit their code and provide CDN service for free. Well,
it would be static hosting, so it won't harm to the 
server.

## Design
1. It would be able to register the package, similar to `bower register`
2. It would be able to host sub domain package, similar to Meteor
3. It should be able to be accessed anywhere including China.
